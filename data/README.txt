Evol1: approx 300 generations on flat terrain then on big arena (not working yet) - evolutions with only body parts, no sensors
Evol2: to be processed after Evol1, add sensors and lightweight body parts - goal: detect and avoid obstacles

Evol11: parallel trial for Evol1 - evolved in e2 area for small obstacles and surmountable walls

Evol21: idem Evol11. From gen 110 evolve with sensors & less body parts
