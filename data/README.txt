Evol1: approx 300 generations on flat terrain then on big arena (not working yet) - evolutions with only body parts, no sensors
Evol2: to be processed after Evol1, add sensors and lightweight body parts - goal: detect and avoid obstacles

Evol11: parallel trial for Evol1 - evolved in e2 area for small obstacles and surmountable walls

Evol21: idem Evol11.
Evol22: Evolved from e21 on flat terrain - only IR sensors as possible body parts evolution
Evol23: Evolved from e22 on big arena - only IR sensors as possible body parts evolution
Evol24: TO DO manually trimmed body - evolve brain on e2 arena? wall arena?
Evol25: In bigarena, only brain, 3 startpos
